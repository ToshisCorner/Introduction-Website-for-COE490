                The quick rundown goes: Filipino, moved to Bahrain for middle school, back to the Philippines for highschool, then moved to Dubai to end off my highschool to (hopefully) complete 
                my college degree.

                </h4>
                <p>
                    Although I go by John, my actual name is John Benedict. John comes from the name of St. John Paul II, and Benedict is the name of the next pope that came to be in 2005,
                    3 years after my birthday. Either my parents predicted that or they're time travelers.

                    I'm currently a 4th year Computer Engineering student at the American Universirty of Sharjah. I can't say I'm super attached to my degree to be honest.
                    If I had the chance to go back in time, I'd definitely look at other options, BUT, I'm already in it for the long haul, and I'm nothing if not consistent. :D
                </p>

                    ● Why Am I Taking Software Engineering?
                </h4>
                <p>
                    Yes, this course is a graduation requirement and I took it cause I have to, but now that I'm informed of the learning approach we have for this course, I'm excited.
                    It's not everyday you get to hop into a course and grab most of your grades from practical stuff, it's a new challenge and a refreshing take for the semester.
                </p>
                <h4>
                    ● What do I Hope to Learn from this Course?
                </h4>
                <p>
                    To be completely honest, I've never been a big fan of coding/programming, so software engineering was a hard sell for me. I know like 2 programming languages (+1 cause I
                    learned HTML to make this website :3), and it wouldn't hurt to learn a few more before I graduate. I'm more interested in actually getting to know the approach to ideation,
                    building, and testing software in a kind-of real-world scenario environment.

                    I shot, edited, and 'color-graded' my first video a year into university. I borrowed my dad's gimbal on a whim and took videos of a family outing. From there, I kept shooting
                    more and more of my life, learning more editing and color grading techniques, and having the most fun I've ever had doing anything.

                    Here's the most recent thing I've done. I like how it turned out but I'm already thinking about how to make the next video with more polish and pizzazz. :D

                    Before you tell me of, "Studying isn't a hobby, you know.", "What's so fun about it?", "Are you really that boring?"
                </p>
                <p>
                    I know. When you reframe the way you approach studying, anyone can find it fun. Yes, I am most likely that boring. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    For real though, I do find pleasure in extended hours of studying. I don't find myself more productive, just that studying can occupy more of my time without me burning out
                    or feeling like I've wasted my time.
