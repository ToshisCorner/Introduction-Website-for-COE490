			<h2>Year at AUS: Fourth Year, First Semester</h2>
			<h2>AUS Major: Computer Engineering</h2>
			<h2>Reasons for pursuing this degree:</h2>
			<p>
			    I'm not super attached to my degree, and given a chance to travel back in time, I would definitely
			    look at other options, but I'm in it for the long haul and I'm nothing if not persistent.

            <h2>Reasons for Taking This Course</h2>
            <p>
                While this course is a graduation requirement, hence the need to take it, I do find myself intrigued
                by the more 'macro-focused' approach that this course takes on learning about software development.

            <p>
                I indulge myself in a multitude of aspects concerned with filmmaking and videography, particularly

            <p>
                Although I did say I spare no particular attachment to my degree, I spent exactly _____ hours
                studying in 2024, an average of about 5 hours a day (though reality was more sporadic).
